# NSC Dev Expo Site

This repository serves as a static site rendering for the Application Development Department at North Seattle College. It leverages Expo for building and deploying web applications with static rendering capabilities.

# Workflows
## Project setup
- Run terminal with `npm install .`  in the cloned project's directory.
- `npm run start:web` to start up the frontend development server.

## Working on a specific page or rendering component
Currently, we are using Stacks to generate dev page environment for developers to work on their page or component. This is a temporary solution that we may remove further in the development cycle. 
- To work on your page, run development script using `npm run start:web`
- Once the dev server starts, the first page will be the home page, but in the URL it will look like 'http://localhost:8081/'
- Navigate to other pages in the `(pages)` directory by adding the name of the file after the root directory in the URL. Example: Student page will be `/student`, about will be `/about`, etc.
Note: Review the video linked in the resource section to gain understanding how expo handles folder structure for routing. Always refer to [expo documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/) for in-depth knowledge in how Expo components work.
